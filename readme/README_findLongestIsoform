##########################


Purpose: to identify the longest isoform for every gene in a FASTA file.


##########################


ARGUMENT OPTIONS:

	-h	--help		show this help message and exit
	-i 	INPUT		Input FASTA File

##########################


REQUIREMENTS:

findLongestIsoform.py uses Python version 3.7

Python libraries that must be installed include:
1. csv
2. argparse
3. Bio.SeqIO

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.


##########################


Input Files:
This program requires one or more FASTA files.

Output Files:
No output file is created. Longest isoform is written to std out. 

##########################


USAGE:

The -i argument is required, followed by the input FASTA file(s). These files either need to have the 7 character long sample name as the last 7 characters, or the last 7 that precede the extension that begins with '.'.

By default, DNA sequences are expected. 

Example usage:
python3 findLongestIsoform.py -i samples/HG00096
